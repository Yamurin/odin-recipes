<h3>Description</h3>

<p> 
  This <i>feijoada</i> recipe is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean stew that 
  maintains the rich smoky, flavors famous in Brazil. Additional meats, including 
  sausage, may be added if desired. This is excellent served over brown rice.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion, divided</li>
  <li>½ cup green onions, chopped</li>
  <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
  <li>1 (12 ounce) package dry black beans, soaked overnight</li>
  <li>2 smoked ham hocks</li>
  <li>8 ounces diced ham</li>
  <li>½ pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>
  <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>
  <li>⅛ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
  <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
  <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>


</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onion, green onions, and garlic;
    cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes. Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. 
    Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender. 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup chopped onion. 
    Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour. Drain and add to beans. 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes. 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper. 
    Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes more. 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving. 
  </li>

</ol>
