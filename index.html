    <h3>What is Brazilian cuisine?</h3>

    <small>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_cuisine">Wikipedia</a></small>

    <p>
      "Brazilian cuisine is the set of cooking practices and traditions of Brazil, 
      and is characterized by European, Amerindian, African, and Asian (Lebanese, 
      Chinese and, most recently, Japanese) influences."
    </p>
    <p>
      It varies greatly by region, reflecting the country's mix of native and
      immigrant populations, and its continental size as well. 
    </p>
    <p>This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences.<class="quote">"</class></p>
